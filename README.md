# RSA 

This is a project I worked on where I decided I would implement my own version of RSA encryption. This is by no means a secure encryption, it doesn't have nearly long enough keys and it lacks padding; however, I may work on this in the future. 

Currently the only function this project has is encrypting and decrypting plain text. However, in the future I could also add digital signing or other parts of the RSA standard.
